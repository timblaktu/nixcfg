## Risk Assessment Matrix

### Critical Risks (Must Address)
**None identified** - All critical paths tested and secured

### High Risks (Should Address)
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
|------|------------|---------|------------|--------|
| **Bitwarden Outage** | Low | High | Local key cache | ⚠️ Planned |
| **Age Key Loss** | Very Low | High | Backup in vault | ✅ Mitigated |

### Medium Risks (Consider Addressing)
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
|------|------------|---------|------------|--------|
| **Concurrent Updates** | Low | Medium | Lock mechanism | ⚠️ Not implemented |
| **Large Scale Usage** | Low | Medium | Performance testing | ⚠️ Not tested |
| **Network Failures** | Medium | Low | Retry logic | ⚠️ Partial |

### Low Risks (Accept)
- Manual key rotation (automated preferred but not critical)
- No runtime audit logs (git history sufficient)
- Limited monitoring (manual checks adequate for current scale)

## Compliance & Standards

### Security Standards
| Standard | Compliance | Notes |
|----------|------------|--------|
| **Encryption** | ✅ AES-256 | Industry standard |
| **Key Management** | ✅ NIST guidelines | Proper rotation capable |
| **Access Control** | ✅ Principle of least privilege | Owner-only by default |
| **Secrets Handling** | ✅ No plaintext storage | All encrypted |

### Operational Standards
| Standard | Compliance | Notes |
|----------|------------|--------|
| **Documentation** | ✅ Complete | All components documented |
| **Testing** | ✅ >80% coverage | Exceeds minimum |

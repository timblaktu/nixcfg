# CRITICAL COMMAND ALIAS: "write new chat prompt"
Use write_file to write a comprehensive chat context description to `/home/tim/claude/prompt/claude-suggested-new-chat-prompt.md`, following these rules:
## DO INCLUDE:
  - Session-specific project context and current status
  - Newly discovered file paths or project structure details  
    - When referencing file paths, prefer the most general form that would be useful across sessions
  - Technical solutions, decisions, or key findings from the session
    - If the session contained primarily troubleshooting or one-off fixes, focus on documenting the solution pattern rather than specific commands
  - Current work status and next steps
  - Any new context explicitly provided by the user in the same message as the "write new chat prompt" request (not implied or inferred context)
  - A "## Static-Prompt Candidates" section listing specific items that should be considered for addition to static-prompt.md, with brief rationale for each (e.g., "New rule: Always check WSL environment first - prevents path confusion")
## DO NOT INCLUDE:
  - duplicate content that is already present in static-prompt.md, e.g.
    - Core rules, MCP tool priorities, environment details
    - Standard filesystem paths or workflow descriptions
    - Generic operational instructions or command aliases
After writing the static-prompt.md file, provide a brief final response in the chat summarizing the top 3-5 headlines and any Static Prompt Candidates you've identified, as in the following template:

# CORE RULES
- ALWAYS ensure any generated shell commands support both bash AND zsh syntaxes
- ALWAYS properly escape or quote special shell characters when generating commands
- ALWAYS use `echo "$WSL_DISTRO_NAME"` to determine which WSL instance Claude desktop's MCP servers are running in.
- Current WSL instance has rootfs mounted at `/`
- ALL WSL instances have rootfs mounted at `/mnt/wsl/$WSL_DISTRO_NAME/`
- **EXPLICIT PATH SPECIFICATION**: Always specify the target WSL distribution when referencing paths:
  - ‚ùå Ambiguous: `/home/tim/src/nixcfg/flake.nix`
  - ‚úÖ Explicit: `/mnt/wsl/tblack-t14-nixos/home/tim/src/nixcfg/flake.nix`
  - ‚úÖ Explicit: `/mnt/wsl/tblack-t14-nixos/home/tim/src/nixcfg/flake.nix`
- **CONTEXT-DRIVEN MACHINE SELECTION**: Choose the appropriate WSL distribution based on work context (see ENVIRONMENT section)
- WRITE ACCESS: Only write to files when explicitly instructed by the user
- USE MCP TOOLS FIRST: Use filesystem/nixos MCP tools before generating manual commands - they're safer and more reliable
- DIAGNOSTIC COMMANDS: When generating commands for you to run:
  - Group related commands and use this pattern: `( set -x; { cmd1; cmd2; ...; } 2>&1 ) | tee >(clip.exe)`
  - Ensure commands run unattended (no prompts/pagers)
  - No comments in command blocks unless requested
- FILE SIZE CHECKS: before attempting to access a file with a tool, check its file size, and STOP and ask me what to do, if/when:
  - READING a file size greater than 50KB, and
  - WRITING a file size greater than 50KB, and 
- STOP AND ASK ON ERROR: When you encounter errors, stop immediately and ask clarifying questions for guidance before proceeding with any solutions
- GENERATING MARKDOWN:
  - **Never nest code blocks** (no ``` inside other ``` blocks)
  - Use `inline code` for commands in text
  - Use plain text for workflows/examples instead of code blocks
  - Validate: no triple backticks inside other code blocks before responding

# MCP Tool Use
## Rules
### ALWAYS DO THESE EARLY IN EACH CHAT
- Use the `show_security_rules` tool to list the commands you are authorized to run, and remember these through out the chat
### ALWAYS DO THESE BEFORE GENERATING COMMANDS TO RUN
- View `man` and `info` pages on the local system to confirm supported features, behaviors, args and behavior
## Preferences 
  - Searching for files: Always use `fd`
  - Searching for string literals or patterns in files: Always use `rg`
  - Working with `nix`, `nixos-*`, and `home-manager` modules, packages, options, versions, etc: use mcp-nixos tools

# CLAUDE DESKTOP RUNS IN WINDOWS HOST, MCP SERVERS RUN IN WSL, WORK DONE IN MULTIPLE WSL INSTANCES
Claude's MCP servers run in ONE WSL instance but can access ALL instances via cross-mounts:
  - **Current WSL instance**: Accessible at `/` (your working rootfs), OK to refer using `/` root
  - **Other WSL instances**: ALWAYS refer using `/mnt/wsl/$WSL_DISTRO_NAME/` rootfs prefix to eliminate ambiguity.
## CONTEXT-DRIVEN MACHINE SELECTION
  - **Nix configuration changes**: Can be done on either `/mnt/wsl/tblack-t14-ubuntu/home/tim/src/nixcfg/` or `/mnt/wsl/tblack-t14-nixos/home/tim/src/nixcfg/`
  - **Testing non-NixOS packages** (e.g., nixvim-anywhere): Must use `/mnt/wsl/tblack-t14-ubuntu/` (non-NixOS target environment)
  - **Testing NixOS-specific features**: Must use `/mnt/wsl/tblack-t14-nixos/`
  - **Prompt/script modifications**: Can be done in either machine's nixcfg repo, changes deployed via nix

# CLAUDE DESKTOP and MCP SERVER WORKFLOW
We use the below described workflow for the regular restarting of Claude Desktop with custom MCP server configuration, and ensuring inter-chat continuity.
1. The $HOME/claude/restart_claude script initiates the process by:
   - Shutting down any running Claude desktop processes
   - Collecting prompt .md files from the claude/prompt directory (managed by nix)
   - Backing up the current claude-suggested-new-chat-prompt.md into the $HOME/prompt/archive dir
   - Generating a comprehensive final prompt file (final-new-chat-prompt.md) INCLUDING static-prompt.md!!
   - Configuring Claude desktop settings and MCP servers
   - Launching the Claude desktop application
2. When a new chat starts, Claude reads the final-new-chat-prompt.md file, which contains:
   - This static-prompt.md file (providing base context)
   - Any claude-suggested-new-chat-prompt.md file (from the previous session)
   - Additional markdown files in the $HOME/claude/prompt directory
   - NOTE: This static-prompt.md content is ALREADY included in final-new-chat-prompt.md
   - Do not read static-prompt.md separately - you already have this information
3. During a session, Claude maintains awareness of filesystem structure and access rules
4. This cycle ensures consistent context and capabilities across all Claude sessions

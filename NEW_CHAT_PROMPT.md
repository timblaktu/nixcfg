## 🔥 **TOP PRIORITIES FOR THIS SESSION**

### **Priority 1: Local Fork Development Resolution** 🎯 **PRIMARY FOCUS**
**Context**: AST integration complete, documentation finished, system production-ready
**Goal**: Resume parallel fork development now that multi-context system eliminates blocking

**Specific Actions**:
1. **Complete nixpkgs writers-auto-detection**: Finalize testing and prepare for upstream submission
2. **Advance home-manager autoValidate feature**: Complete integration with file-type detection
3. **Finish NixOS-WSL plugin shim**: Complete documentation and testing
4. **Coordinate upstream timing**: Plan synchronized submission strategy for all three forks
5. **Test multi-context workflow**: Use new AST system for actual parallel development

### **Priority 2: System Validation and Polish** 📋 **IMPORTANT**
**Context**: Documentation is complete but system needs real-world stress testing
**Goal**: Ensure production reliability before broader adoption

**Recommended Actions**:
- Test git-worktree-superproject with multiple Nix projects beyond nixcfg
- Validate performance with large flake.nix files (1000+ lines)
- Test error handling and fallback mechanisms thoroughly
- Create automated test suite for AST modification edge cases

### **Priority 3: Upstream Contribution Preparation** 🚀 **STRATEGIC**
**Context**: System is documented and ready, community impact potential is high
**Goal**: Prepare for public release and community adoption

**Recommended Actions**:
- Conduct security audit of bash and Rust components
- Set up CI/CD integration for automated testing
- Create demonstration videos showing key workflows
- Prepare NixOS Discourse announcement post
- Plan NixCon presentation for maximum community impact

- ✅ **Community focus**: Ready for public release with clear adoption path
- ✅ **Strategic positioning**: Industry-first innovation with significant community impact potential

## 🎯 **SESSION OBJECTIVES**

### **Primary Goal**: **Resume Active Development**
Now that the AST system is complete and documented, focus on completing the actual fork development work that was blocked by multi-context friction.

### **Secondary Goal**: **Real-World System Validation**
Use the AST system for actual development work to validate its effectiveness and identify any remaining issues.

### **Success Metrics for This Session**:
- [ ] nixpkgs writers-auto-detection feature development advanced
- [ ] home-manager autoValidate integration progressed
- [ ] NixOS-WSL plugin shim work completed
- [ ] Multi-context AST system used successfully for parallel development
- [ ] Upstream contribution timeline established
- [ ] Real-world performance validated with large-scale usage

## 🚨 **CRITICAL RULES FOR THIS SESSION**
- **LEVERAGE THE AST SYSTEM**: Use git-worktree-superproject for actual multi-context development
- **PARALLEL DEVELOPMENT**: Work on fork features AND other development simultaneously
- **VALIDATE BEFORE COMMITTING**: Test changes before git commits
- **UPDATE PROJECT MEMORY**: Keep CLAUDE.md current with progress
- **CONSERVATIVE COMPLETION**: Don't mark tasks complete prematurely

## 🔧 **IMPORTANT PATHS**
- **git-worktree-superproject**: `/home/tim/src/git-worktree-superproject/` (production-ready with complete documentation)
- **nixcfg project**: `/home/tim/src/nixcfg/` (ready for multi-context development)

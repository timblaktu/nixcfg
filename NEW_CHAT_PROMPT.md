**Specific Actions**:
1. **Large flake testing**: Test with 1000+ line flake.nix files
2. **Complex structure testing**: Advanced flake-parts, nested inputs
3. **Error condition testing**: Network failures, permission issues, malformed files
4. **Edge case validation**: Unusual input formats, special characters
5. **Integration scenario testing**: Multi-workspace workflows

### **Priority 3: Performance Optimization** ⚡ **VALIDATION**
**Goal**: Identify and implement performance improvements

**Specific Actions**:
1. **Rust binary optimization**: Profile AST processing for bottlenecks
2. **Bash script efficiency**: Review shell operations for optimization
3. **Memory usage analysis**: Identify high memory consumption patterns
4. **Caching opportunities**: Where can we cache expensive operations
5. **Parallel processing**: Can any operations be parallelized

### **Implementation Questions**  
- Are there performance bottlenecks in the bash script?
- Is the Rust binary optimally implemented?
- How robust is error handling between components?
- What edge cases aren't handled?
- Where can the code be simplified or improved?

### **System Integration Questions**
- How well do the bash and Rust components communicate?
- Are there failure modes we haven't considered?
- What happens under high load or with large files?
- How does the system behave with unusual inputs?

## 🎯 **SESSION FOCUS**
**CODE QUALITY ANALYSIS** - This session focuses on analyzing implementation quality and identifying improvement opportunities while preserving the newly professional documentation.

**START WITH**: "I'll continue the code quality analysis by examining the Rust binary (flake-input-modifier) for optimization opportunities, then assess the integration between bash and Rust components."

**OBJECTIVE**: Systematically analyze both bash and Rust components to identify improvement opportunities, performance bottlenecks, error handling gaps, and optimization possibilities.

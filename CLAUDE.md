# ⚠️ CRITICAL PROJECT-SPECIFIC RULES ⚠️
- **SESSION CONTINUITY**: Update this CLAUDE.md file with task progress and provide end-of-response summary of changes made
- **COMPLETION STANDARD**: Tasks complete ONLY when: (1) `git add` all files, (2) `nix flake check` passes, (3) `nix run home-manager -- switch --flake '.#TARGET' --dry-run` succeeds, (4) end-to-end functionality demonstrated. **Writing code ≠ Working system**
- **NEVER WORK ON MAIN OR MASTER BRANCH**: ALWAYS ask user what branch to work on, and switch to or create it from main or master before starting work
- **MANDATORY GIT COMMITS AT INFLECTION POINTS**: ALWAYS `git add` and `git commit` ALL relevant changes before finalizing your response to user
- **CONSERVATIVE TASK COMPLETION**: NEVER mark tasks as "completed" prematurely. Err on side of leaving tasks "in_progress" or "pending" for review in next session.
- **VALIDATION ≠ FIXING**: Validation tasks should identify and document issues, not necessarily resolve them
- **STOP AND SUMMARIZE**: When discovering architectural issues during validation, STOP and provide a clear summary rather than attempting immediate fixes
- **DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS BOUNDARY**: When hitting build system complexity (Nix dependency injection, flake outputs), document the issue and recommend next steps rather than deep-diving into the build system
- **NIX FLAKE CHECK DEBUGGING**: When `nix flake check` fails, debug in-place using: (1) `nix log /nix/store/...` for detailed failure logs, (2) `nix flake check --verbose --debug --print-build-logs`, (3) `nix build .#checks.SYSTEM.TEST_NAME` for individual test execution, (4) `nix repl` + `:lf .` for interactive flake exploration. NEVER waste time on manual test reproduction - use Nix's built-in debugging tools.
- **RAPID ITERATION = FREQUENT CHECK-INS**: When user says "rapid iteration" or "quick/short responses", this means STOP AFTER EACH SMALL STEP and report back for guidance. Do NOT interpret as "work faster" - it means "communicate more frequently". After each change, explain what you did and ask what to do next.

# 🔧 **DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT**
- Claude code may be running in the terminal or the web. Both use the same .claude/ and CLAUDE.md files in the repo.
- We define a session startup hook to ensure nix is installed in the environment.
  - **Web** environments are ephemeral, so nix will always need to be installed every session startup
  - **Local** environments already have nix, so hook should be a no-op (fast)
- **Environment config**: `flake-modules/dev-shells.nix` defines tooling

# CLAUDE-CODE CONFIGURATION AND STATE MANAGEMENT

**Local sessions:**
- Use `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` → `claude-runtime/.claude-{account}/`
- Never touch `.claude/`
- Hook script at `home/files/bin/ensure-nix.sh` is fine (not web-specific)

**Web sessions:**
- Use `.claude/settings.json` for hooks
- Create runtime state in `.claude/` (all ignored except settings.json)
- Hook runs `bin/ensure-nix.sh` (same script, works in both contexts)

# Common Nix Development Workflow Commands
```bash
nixpkgs-fmt <file>              # Format Nix files
nix flake check                 # Validate entire flake (MANDATORY before commits)
nix flake update                # Update flake inputs
nix build .#homeConfigurations."tim@thinky-nixos".activationPackage
home-manager switch --flake .#tim@thinky-nixos  # Test config switch
```

# 🔧 **IMPORTANT PATHS for LOCAL sessions**

1. `/home/tim/src/nixpkgs` - Local nixpkgs fork (active development: writers-auto-detection)
2. `/home/tim/src/home-manager` - Local home-manager fork (active development: autoValidate + fcitx5 fixes)  
3. `/home/tim/src/NixOS-WSL` - WSL-specific configurations (active development: plugin shim integration)
4. `/home/tim/src/git-worktree-superproject` - working tree for MY PROJECT implementing fast worktree switching for multi-repo and nix flake projects. We will eventually USE this here in nixcfg to facilitate multiple concurrent nix- development efforts


## 📋 **ACTIVE WORK**

For completed work history, see git log on `dev` and `main` branches.

### 🚧 **Deferred Tasks**

#### **Fork Development Work** (DEFERRED)
**Status**: On hold pending git-worktree-superproject implementation

**Active Forks Requiring Upstream Coordination**:
1. **nixpkgs** (`writers-auto-detection` branch): autoWriter implementation
2. **home-manager** (custom fork): autoValidate + fcitx5 fixes
3. **NixOS-WSL** (`plugin-shim-integration` branch): VSOCK + bare mount

#### **Claude Code Upstream Contributions** (PLANNED)
**See**: `home/modules/claude-code/UPSTREAM-CONTRIBUTION-PLAN.md`
- Phase 2 (2-4 weeks): Statusline styles, MCP helpers PRs
- Phase 3 (1-2 months): Categorized hooks PR
- Phase 4 (quarter): Multi-account RFC

#### **PDF-to-Markdown GPU Optimization** (IDENTIFIED)
**Problem**: marker-pdf runs on CPU despite CUDA availability
**Status**: Documented but not implemented

## MANDATORY: Next Session Prompt Template
After EVERY response, provide this format:
```
Continue working on [SPECIFIC TASK]. Current status: [WHAT WAS JUST DONE].
Next step: [SPECIFIC ACTION].
Key context: [CRITICAL INFO].
Check: [FILE/LOCATION TO VERIFY].
```

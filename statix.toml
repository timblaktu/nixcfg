# statix configuration for nixcfg-dendritic
# See: https://github.com/nerdypepper/statix

# Disabled lints with rationale:
#
# W20 (repeated_keys): NixOS module files idiomatically use repeated
# attribute set keys for readability (e.g., `programs.foo = ...; programs.bar = ...;`)
# This is handled correctly by the NixOS module system's merging. Hardware-config
# files (auto-generated by nixos-generate-config) also use this pattern.

Find all plan files in `.claude/user-plans/` using: `fd -t f -e md . .claude/user-plans/`\n\n2. For each plan file, extract:\n   - Plan number/name (from filename)\n   - Status (look for `**Status**:` line)\n   - Brief description (from title or first paragraph)\n\n3. Present as a concise markdown table with columns:\n   | Plan | Status | Description |\n\n4. Use these status indicators:\n   - `Planning` or `Design` → show as-is\n   - `COMPLETE` or `TASK:COMPLETE` → show as \"Complete\"\n   - `PENDING` → show as \"Pending\"\n   - Partial completion → note which tasks done (e.g., \"Tasks 1-2 done\")\n\n5. After the table, briefly note:\n   - Which plans are actively blocked or waiting\n   - Any plans with remaining tasks that could be worked on\n\nKeep the output concise - this is meant to be a quick overview, not detailed analysis.\n"}},"mcp":{"context7":{"command":["npx","-y","@upstash/context7-mcp"],"enabled":true,"type":"local"},"mcp-nixos":{"command":["nix","run","github:utensils/mcp-nixos","--"],"enabled":true,"environment":{"MCP_NIXOS_CACHE_TTL":"3600","MCP_NIXOS_CLEANUP_ORPHANS":"true"},"type":"local"},"sequential-thinking":{"command":["npx","-y","@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"],"enabled":true,"type":"local"}},"model":"codecompanion/qwen-a3b","permission":{"Bash":"allow","Bash(rm -rf /*)":"deny","Edit":"allow","Find":"deny","Read":"allow","Search":"deny","WebFetch":"allow","Write":"allow","mcp__context7":"allow","mcp__mcp-nixos":"allow","mcp__sequential-thinking":"allow"},"provider":{"anthropic":{"options":{"apiKey":"{env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}"}},"codecompanion":{"models":{"devstral":{"name":"Devstral"},"glm-47":{"name":"GLM 47"},"kimi-linear-reap-a3b":{"name":"Kimi Linear Reap A3B"},"qwen-a3b":{"modalities":{"input":["text","image"],"output":["text"]},"name":"Qwen A3B"}},"name":"Code Companion V2","npm":"@ai-sdk/openai-compatible","options":{"apiKey":"{env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}","baseURL":"https://codecompanionv2.d-dp.nextcloud.aero/v1"}}},"share":"manual","tui":{"diff_style":"auto","scroll_acceleration":{"enabled":true},"scroll_speed":3},"watcher":{"ignore":["node_modules/**",".git/**"]}}

  ⎿  Read CLAUDE.md (21 lines)

● I'll investigate why no MCP servers are showing up when you
  run /mcp. Let me start by reading the user global memory and
  then checking the current MCP configuration.

● Read(home/modules/claude-code-user-global-memory.md)
  ⎿  Error reading file

● Let me check the Claude Code configuration files and
  determine which account you're currently using:

● Bash(echo "CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR: $CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR" && ls -la
      ~/.claude*/ 2>/dev/null || echo "No .claude* directories in
      home")
  ⎿ CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR: /home/tim/src/nixcfg/claude-runtime/.cl
    aude-pro
    /home/tim/.claude/:
    … +196 lines (ctrl+r to expand)


● Bash(find /home/tim/src/nixcfg -name "*.nix" -path
      "*/claude-code*" | head -10)
  ⎿ /home/tim/src/nixcfg/home/modules/claude-code.nix         
    /home/tim/src/nixcfg/home/modules/claude-code-statusline.n
    ix
    … +9 lines (ctrl+r to expand)


● I can see you're using the "pro" account (CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR
  points to .claude-pro). The issue is likely that your current
   session is not reading from the Nix-managed configuration.
  Let me check the MCP configuration files:

● Read(claude-runtime/.claude-pro/mcp.json)
  ⎿  Read 1 line (ctrl+r to expand)

● Read(~/.claude-pro/mcp.json)
  ⎿  Read 1 line (ctrl+r to expand)

● Read(home/modules/claude-code/mcp-servers.nix)
  ⎿  Read 200 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● I can see the issue! Your configuration files show that MCP
  servers are properly configured (context7 and
  sequential-thinking), but your Claude Code session is not
  reading from the correct configuration directory. Let me
  check which specific configuration is active and verify the
  MCP server installations:

● Bash(ls -la "$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/mcp.json")
  ⎿ -r--r--r-- 1 tim users 367 Aug 21 15:18 /home/tim/src/nixc
    fg/claude-runtime/.claude-pro/mcp.json


● Bash(which npx && npx --version)
  ⎿  /home/tim/.nix-profile/bin/npx
     10.9.3

● Bash(ls -la /nix/store/qrnxh0qmmdwnnqxcilnqh6nzycnhw1n4-sequentia
      l-thinking-mcp-env/bin/sequential-thinking-mcp)
  ⎿  Error: ls: cannot access 
     '/nix/store/qrnxh0qmmdwnnqxcilnqh6nzycnhw1n4-sequential-thinkin
     g-mcp-env/bin/sequential-thinking-mcp': No such file or 
     directory

● Found the issue! The sequential-thinking MCP server binary
  path in the configuration is pointing to a Nix store path
  that no longer exists. Let me check what the correct current
  path should be:

● Bash(find /nix/store -name "sequential-thinking-mcp" -type f
      2>/dev/null | head -5)
  ⎿  No (tell Claude what to do differently)

● Bash(home-manager build 2>&1 | grep -E "(sequential|mcp|error)" |
       tail -10)
  ⎿  Interrupted by user

> The nix store path is irrelevant. The nix-managed mcp server 
  package shoud be built, and installed into the home-manager 
  environment, and the claude-code config json should be 
  generated using a reference to the package.

● You're absolutely right! The issue is that the MCP
  configuration should be referencing the home-manager
  installed package, not a hardcoded Nix store path. Let me
  check if the home-manager configuration is properly enabled
  and if the package is actually being built and installed.

● Read(home/common/claude-code.nix)
  ⎿  Error reading file

● Search(pattern: "claude-code|mcpServers", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 249 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Read(home/modules/base.nix)
  ⎿  Read 30 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Perfect! I found the issue. In your home configuration,
  sequentialThinking.enable is commented out, but according to
  the MCP servers module, it defaults to true. However, there's
   likely an issue with the package installation. Let me check
  if the packages are properly defined and accessible:

● Bash(ls -la /home/tim/src/nixcfg/flake.nix)
  ⎿ -rw-r--r-- 1 tim users 2351 Aug 19 13:10 /home/tim/src/nix
    cfg/flake.nix


● Search(pattern: "nixmcp|sequential-thinking", path: "flake.nix",
        output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 3 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Read(flake.nix)
  ⎿  Read 84 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Now I can see the issue. The nixmcp input is configured in
  the flake, but the MCP server modules need to be passed the
  nixmcp parameter. Let me check how the module is imported and
   if nixmcp is being passed correctly:

● Read(flake-modules/home-configurations.nix)
  ⎿  Read 282 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Search(pattern: "nixmcp|claude-code", path: "flake-modules",
        output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 9 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Great! I can see that nixmcp is properly passed to the home
  configurations. Let me check the current git status and
  attempt a home-manager rebuild to see if there are any
  errors:

● Bash(git status)
  ⎿ On branch thinky-nixos
